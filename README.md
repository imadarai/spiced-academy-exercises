# Spiced-Academy-Exercises
Between January and March 2020, I attended [SPICED Academy](http://www.spiced-academy.com/), an intensive 12-week coding program focused on Full Stack JavaScript Web Development in Berlin, Germany. During this program, I built a portfolio of web applications.

The first six weeks were focused on learning different stacks and be able to fully understand how they all work together to build web services and applications.  Following is a week by week breakdown: 

**1 Week ---> HTML/CSS Lab, Media Queries, Javascript**

**2 Week ---> DOM Events, Flexbox, CSS Grid**

**3 Week ---> jQuery, JSON, localStorage**

**4 Week ---> XMLHttpRequest, jQuery.ajax, Spotify Api, Handlebars, GitHub Api**

**5 Week ---> Event Emitters, Callbacks, Node Modules**

**6 Week ---> Express, Basic Auth, Twitter Api, Promises, JEST**
